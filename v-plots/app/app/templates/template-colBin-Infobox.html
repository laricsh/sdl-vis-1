        <h3>Requirements for Dataset File:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Comma separated CSV file.</li>
          <li>Any kind of data is allowed for the binning as the histograms will be created based on height of the bins.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Creation of Histogram:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>After CSV upload, the user needs to select a column from the drop-down menu as a filter. The drop-down menu is generated from the uploaded file.</li>
          <li>The distinct values from the selected column is used to generate filter values for top/left and bottom/right distribution.</li>
          <li>These filter values are used to group each column into two groups.</li>
          <li>If the selected filter value does not exist in rest of the columns(other than filter column), those values from a column are selected that are not in the filter column.</li>
          <li>The height of each column is calculated as: Number of rows in a column that has the selected filter value in the filter column / Total number of selected filter value in filter column</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Example Dataset:</h3>
        <table class="table">
          <thead>
          <tr>
            <td>Group</td>
            <td>one</td>

          For e.g., for the given data set example, consider the user selects <i>Group</i> as a column to act as a filter. Here <i>Group</i> has <i>YES</i> and <i>NO</i> as distinct value.
          There can be more than 2 distinct values. Consider for top/left distribution, the user selects <i>YES</i> as a filter. Now, in the rest of the columns, there is no cell with <i>YES</i> value.
          In this case, for binning all columns based on <i>YES</i>, all those values will be selected which are not in the <i>Group</i> column. So for column <i>one</i>, 5 and 8 will be selected for filter value <i>YES</i>.
          Here the height of bin for column one would be: 2/3.
          Similarly, the height for each column will be calculated for this particular filter value.<br/>
          Same process will follow for each column for a filter value selected for bottom/right distribution.
